# BEING MATERIAL
## WORKSHOP ST JOOST ~ 11 MAR 2020

The goal is to get an insight in your work method, how you approach an environment/landscape or environmental data (in your case (seismic data) in your research/work. And how, where and why composing for the senses comes in.

Secondly The student will be active in the workshop. At the end we will present the ‘outcomes’ to each other and reflect on what we’ve learned. We hope the students will use their new skills when we travel to Iceland and go on a field research trip.


# Schedule

## 10:00 Jarl Introductions

## 10:15-11:00 my work: Sensory Cartographies
* Sensory Cartographies
  * (5m) conceptual strategy : opposing universal representations of space and relationships
  * (5m) looking to examples elsewhere: Marshall islands stick maps, Inuit tactile maps
  * (5m) instrumentarium
  * (5m) perception and sensation / augmentations and transformations
    * sensory gating
    * neuroplasticity (example)
  * (5m) compositional and mapping strategies
  * (5m) idea of "field notes" / describe such methods
  * (5m) video essay "The Sensory Cartographer"

## 11:00-12:00 my work: The Intimate Earthquake Archive
* The Intimate Earthquake Archive
  * (5m) TIEA video, recap of the context
  * (5m) overview of the "medium" we created, sometimes a necessity ~ this is what I mean by "fundamental media research", we are continuing in this direction as the media research we are doing for this and Sensory Cartographies starts to blend together
  * (5m) understanding seismic events
  * (5m) compositional strategies for worn experiences based on the phenomenon itself
  * (10m) a hands-on dive into earthquake data / show how it can be taken from the KNMI website and extracted ~ iceland seismic data repository
  * (10m) mapping a datastream to the audio domain to be used elsewise
  * (10m) editing quake files in audacity / simple demonstration of envelope based modulation


## 12:00-12:30 Lunch Break

## 12:30-13:45 Composition Project
Abstract Storytelling / Composition Strategies
* (15m) Discussion of concepts / examples
  * Le Guin
  * Oliveros
  * Other (soundwalks, rule-based systems?)
* (30m) Go out and record / come up with a ruleset
* (30m) Editing & Compositing

## 13:45-14:00 Sharing & Reflection



* Basic recording & sound editing techniques in audacity
* Abstract storytelling: discussion of Le Guin, carrier bag
* Compositional strategies: discussion of Oliveros' EarthEars
* (Autoethnographical method?)
* Listening and recording exercise
* (Special platforms for geolocated audio?)
