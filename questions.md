# Vibe / Groove of Presentation
* This is a celebration we are having together
* A victory lap
* It is also a replay of a football goal (my proposal arguments)
* I am capturing the emotional core and excitement of the project

# Panel
My proposal takes some inspiration from Thor's research topic on human-machine musicianship and the combined philosoph-cognitive neuroscience proposal on the predictive mind by Anil and Andy Clark.

# Question Preparedness

## What are you trying to do?
Develop a neuro-aesthetic artistic method and an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for computational aesthetics that defy classification; constantly surfing uncertainty.

## What are your objectives? (absolutely no jargon)
I will make three manifestations each investigating a specific aspect of embodied, enactive experience with AI aesthetics:
1. voice
2. movement
3. time

## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Most artists work on the basis of intuition with ML systems; or take an "embrace the strangenes" approach. In the humanities, theories exist for encounters with artworks, and especially in media theory for the AI experience - more recently those based in neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).

## What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
I will develop a rigorous method based in cognitive neuroscience to develop such aesthetics. And a corresponding theory around these experiences based within predictive processing / predictive mind hypotheses.

## How does this pitch match the Leverhulme schema?
* fundamentally multidisciplinary proposal
* leverages the various schools of knowledge within the Leverhulme schema
* promoting excellence in interdisciplinary research
* art practice is an interstitial fluid; the ether that enables nonlinear connections between theory, practice, science and humanities research

## Whose umwelt? (is it the AI, or yours, where is the focus?)
* The umwelt is that of the AI, the non-human system
* Zishin Liu's "Three Body Problem" ~ human culture reflected back through an unfathomable sensorium
* the focus is on the encounter between a perciever and such an aesthetic entity

## Who cares? (if you are successful, what difference will it make?)
* create a useful neuroaesthetic artistic method and compelling work that raises important questions
* a theoretical ecology that can become useful in the discourses around algorithmic world-making
* unique case studies for cognitive science research

## Since you already have a career, why do you want to do a PhD at Sussex?
* institutional support / resources
* a diverse research community and training resources
* mentorship and an intellectual community

## What do you mean "introspection" of ML systems?
* feature perceptualization techniques
* making "explainable" the representational structures within a multi-layer neural network
* techniques to perceptualize the dynamics of the training process itself (example: sonification of linear regression)

## What role does "introspection of AI" have in your work?
* creating aesthetic artefacts from non-generative models
* one of many possible computational techniques towards creating "alien" aesthetic elements, alongside models that themselves are generative
* aesthetic results of these techniques are culturally significant and should not be ignored, e.g. see Google's Deep Dream)
* However primary focus is on the perceptual encounter with aesthetics produced by AI systems

## How do you know if you have succeeded or failed? What are the exams for success?
* qualitative feedback during public encounters
* qualitative studies (combined with above)
* adoption and discourse around my ideas outside of Sussex
* interest and discourse around my work outside of Sussex

## How generous are you? / to the community (?)
* connect with spaces outside of the uni: Lighthouse
* organizing collective study and workshops
* open source repositories for hardware/software

## What did you mean by the line about "potentially culminating in a larger work" in your proposal?

* I will be making three large works. But each will likely involve smaller experiments / sketches that go into the production of the larger work.


(this and other things were a little unclear in the proposal, and need to be clarified in a clear and punchy way, even before the question is asked)
> Methodologically I intend to approach these questions through artistic practice; specifically, the development of new sonic-compositional work and the development of software tools and `HARDWARE` techniques which support the creation of such work. __I aim to create a series of small works, potentially culminating in a larger work such as an installation or suite of music.__ The works will each examine a different manifestation of aesthetics emerging from the application of current machine learning systems. __These smaller experiments will include, at the very least, one exploration focused on the use of speech and voice synthesis systems as tools for composing alien soundworlds, and another focused on creating interactive robotic artworks that convey an aesthetic of otherness through sound, movement and temporal dynamics.__

This word "potentially" is very bad. And that sentence is in fact wrong...

## How do I explain "Alien Umwelt"

> I propose the concept of “Alien Umwelt” as a theoretical starting point for bringing these theories from culture and mind together. The term is constituted of a perceptual-psychological phenomenon the alien (which here I intend to describe sensory experiences which hitherto defy classification, or problematize feelings of familiarity and strangeness) and Umwelts, biologist Jakob von Uexküll’s concept of how different species of life experience themselves in the world. An “Alien Umwelt” is thus a sensory-perceptive experience of strangeness that is dependent on an enactive understanding of artistic perception.


## Is "uncanny" the right terminology?
* the dynamic between the familiar and strange
* "Weird" fiction
* Want to buck the 1990's explosion of the "uncanny", go back to Freud "cleaning the pollution and distortion of the 90's"
* An entactive / dynamic between familiar and strange >> revisit/prune early thinkers such as Freud, Fanon,  
* "AlterModernism"
* "The New"
* The Stranger, Simmel

## Books on Art (revealing this as a network of thought I can bring to the community at Sussex)
* The Necessity of Art: Ernst Fischer (response to novelty, danger, art as an object, radical imagination as part of our subjectivity > evolutionary perspective)
  * also introduction by Berger is worth reading
* Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music
* Haunted Weather (Toop)
* The Rhythmic Event / AUDINT > Auditory Intelligence / London-based
* The Irrational Man



## Do you have questions for us?
* could you imagine a professional artist working in your research lab; what would that ideal scenario look like to you?
* what can you imagine would be the social and political effects of your research?
* what do you believe your research has to offer artistic practitioners?
