# Presentation Notes

## 1 The problem / topic
In Cixin Liu's "Three Body Problem" ... an alien race makes a journey from their star system to colonize the earth. The journey takes 400 years, and during the course, while studying earth culture from afar, the alien civilization becomes obsessed with human artistic output, and alien works of art begin to be shown and celebrated on earth for their novelty. A mirror reflected back through a non-human perceptual understanding.

(AI = statistical models / learning algorithms)

AI-based cultural products are increasingly consumed.
People are drawn to these cultural products because they play with our sense of familiar and unfamiliar, are strange, grotesque, magical.

There has been much work done in the humanities on the encounter with art, with the novel, new and extranging, and similarly in neuroscience there are theories developed to understand aesthetic encounters: neuroaesthetic approaches, for example. But we don't have a specific neuroaesthetic framework for understanding the specific dynamic between familiar and unfamiliar encountered with AI generated aesthetic products.

(questions)
Examples of such aesthetics and interactions (Lars/Holly)
DeForrest Brown JR 'rhythmanalytical' / Kepla

Recreate the strong points of my argument in my proposal.. such as

The specific combination of art, the “uncanny” aesthetics of machine learning systems, and cognitive science is a specific and unique research theme that appears to present a specific niche of knowledge that has yet to be explored fully.


## 2 Questions Arise

Here I introduce the concept of "Alien Umwelt" as a starting point for understanding this encounter.

> There are many theories of estrangement from psychology in Freud's "Unheimlich", sociology Georg Simmel's "The Stranger", and more recently in the multidisciplinary spirit of cultural studies, the "xenofeminism" manifesto of Laboria Cuboniks or Luciana Parisi's "alien subjectivity" of the algorithmic.

> Here I use "alien" with an intent to describe experiences
which hitherto defy classification, or problematize feelings of familiarity and strangeness. Or, in the words of Andy Clark:  
> The second term: Umwelt, is biologist Jakob von Uexküll’s concept of how different species of life experience themselves in the world. What is it like to be a bat? - for example.
> An “Alien Umwelt” is thus a sensory-perceptive experience of strangeness that is dependent on an enactive understanding of artistic perception.

How can approaches from neuroscience be used to develop and interrogate artistic method?

## 3 My Experience / Artistic Approach / Skills
#### Sensory Cartographies
Visited a cogsci symposium in Leiden, and later visited London & Brighton out of interest into interoception research

#### Intimate Earthquake Archive

#### A Data Centre At the end of History


Examples:
* Sensory Cartography / Interest in Interoception / wearables
  * Visited a cogsci symposium in Leiden, and later visited London & Brighton out of interest into interoception research
* Anatomies of Intelligence
* At the End of History


## 4 My Response: A Trilogy
(this slide should propose a *solution* to my questions)
Integrate references from U Sussex into these projects to explain in a more integrated way why Sussex is the right place.

Unique environment at Sussex. Composers, philosophers, scientific researchers, cultural theorists. I am fascinated by this environment. Mention the school of cultural studies and their current theme. As well as the department of philosophy. Group references as applicable.

And at Sussex I can go much deeper. Sussex is uniquely positioned to address these questions.
(with Sussex, I will go deeper? how to phrase this?)
(they think: right: we do have these things)
Long history of interdisciplinary collaboration
Rich research community with crossover between the arts, hard sciences, and humanities
Innovative music researchers
Robotics lab
Andy Clark (Philosophy, Surfing Uncertainty)
Margaret Boden (Informatics, Cognitive Science, AI Creativity)
Expertise Sackler Centre of Consciousness Studies

Name dropping:
* Andy Clark (Philosophy, Surfing Uncertainty)
* Margaret Boden (Informatics, Cognitive Science, AI Creativity)

For each, give an example of what I might make.

1. Voice
Holly Herndon. School of voice. Samuel Beckett project. ALMAT.
Cognition of speech perception? Sinetone speech?
<p>Focus on speech synthesis & language. Mention my Samuel Beckett project and research with ALMAT.
Cognition of speech perception. Sinetone speech.</p>


2. Movement
Robotics. Marco's work. Blood sweeping arm. The blind robot.
Sussex people?
Masks. Not arms. Wearable. Social Interface/Interaction.
Be mindful of curatorial discussion around facial representation in the arts / "some faces are more valuable than others"
Robotics. Examples of robotic artworks that try to create an experience of the alien.
Marco Donnraumma's amygdala, The Blind Robot, others..?
Good place to make a connection to the robotics lab @ Sussex and their facilities. Also connect to predictive mind hypothesis.


3. Time
Predictive cognition. Warrick's work. School of composition.
An epic suite, of sorts
And aesthetic ruleset, a theory, to follow and dig deeper deeper into
<p>Predictive cognition. Mention connection to music composition.
  Perception of duration in art has shifted significantly through digital mediation.
  Duration as a manifestation of time.
  Specific Sussex references: predictive cognition, Warrick..
  Also Warrick Roseboom (Sackler Centre) work on time perception.
  Use the term: "duration"? Experiences of duration.
  I'd like to make an album / suite. "Anticipation"
  Expected/Unexpected often talked about in music --> I want to reframe as Familiar/Unfamiliar. Precognition of time.
</p>

> From neuroaesthetics on Wikipedia: Aesthetic experiences are an emergent property of interactions among a triad of neural systems that involve sensory-motor, emotion-valuation, and meaning-knowledge circuitry

How to group references, and theories? A starting point.


## 5 Why Me?
Navigating the accepted frameworks of scientific knowledge as an artist is hard. We are often shoe-horned in.

I am experienced in navigating this zone; negotiating rigor with freedom, imagination, play and intuition.

* Co-developed the digital media bachelors program at the University of Leuphana; where I was the only practitioner in a cultural studies department. Won the Leuphana Teaching award for hybrid/interdisciplinary pedagogy.
* I've worked actively at the intersection of theory and practice, culture, philosophy and science (Computational Ontologies, Automation Representation, Live Code and Live Algorithms)


* Worked professionally as a software engineer for 3 years
* Able to design and produce custom hardware and software
* Applied AI in most recent work


I am an accomplished, practicing artist who brings that professionalism with me in my work here. Thus I will strive to make work at Sussex that succeeds outside the ivory tower.
* I've been commissioned to create work for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam
* commissioned to compose music and created interactive stage sets for top-ranking, nationally touring dance and theatre ensembles in the NL.

My approach to exploring artistic questions is multi-faceted. It involves deep material/empirical research; cultural research; and collaboration/discussion through a curatorial practice. I am very comfortable organizing cultural events to bring minds together around the questions I am researching. And to draw a red line from material, empirical research to cultural studies and philosophy through the unique vehicle of interdisciplinary art. I also have a wide and lively network of practitioners in the arts and research to draw on and make collaborations between Sussex and outwards (e.g. Augmented Instruments Lab in London, Critical Media Lab Basel, Centre for Digital Culture Leuphana and multiple arts institutions in the NL such as V2, iii, Fiber, Rewire Festival, ...) for presentation & dissemination.
* The Reading Room
* Two Sussex folks present in various forms: Andy Clark in our Natural Born Cyborgs session / Warrick in our "Time in the Age of Algorithms" session.

<h4>My approach to exploring artistic questions is multi-faceted</h4>
my practice is made of a multitude of practices
<ul>
  "multi-faceted" is an ugly word, it doesn't have gravitas
  it escapes specifics (multitude/multiple is better)
  needs to express multiple existing at the same time
  simultaneous
  multi-core
  <todo>I am very comfortable organizing cultural events to bring minds together around the questions I am researching. And to draw a red line from material, empirical research to cultural studies and philosophy through the unique vehicle of interdisciplinary art.</todo>
<li> strong international network

							accomplished artist with an active career</p>
						<todo>I will make work at Sussex with the aim for it to thrive outside the ivory tower. They might ask: if you already have an artistic career - why do you want to do a PhD? I'm not sure I know the answer to this myself yet!</todo>

__Thank you very much. I look forward to fielding your questions about this project__

__Moreover, I look forward to working in the company of researchers who nurture a healthy and compassionate working environment based in curiosity, rigor and care__

## Revised Gantt Chart
Include a dynamic between theory and practice throughout.
Each project requires a literature review, and chapter writing, discussion and symposia, etc.
Theory is part of all the work.
