# Alien Umwelts

# 1 We have a problem
We don't have an artistic or theoretical framework for understanding the uncanny and alien in AI Art.

* What do you mean by "uncanny"?
* Give examples of such aesthetics and interactions

The specific combination of sonic art, the “uncanny” aesthetics of machine learning systems, and cognitive science is a specific and unique research theme that appears to
present a specific niche of knowledge that has yet to be explored fully.


# 2 This Raises Certain Questions
My research questions
* What kind of new aesthetic concepts are necessary to address this theme?
* What new artistic forms can such a research endeavor produce?
* How can research approaches from cognitive science
be used to inform and interrogate this work as it evolves in theory and practice?

# 3 I have addressed some of these in my previous work
__begin with video__

And at Sussex I can go much deeper. Sussex is uniquely positioned to address these questions.

* Long history of interdisciplinary collaboration
* Crossover between the arts, hard sciences, and humanities

Name dropping:
* Andy Clark (Philosophy, Surfing Uncertainty)
* Margaret Boden (Informatics, Cognitive Science, AI Creativity)


Examples:
* Sensory Cartography / Interest in Interoception / wearables
  * Visited a cogsci symposium in Leiden, and later visited London & Brighton out of interest into interoception research
* Anatomies of Intelligence
* At the End of History


# 4 The Three Projects / Themes


Integrate references from U Sussex into these projects to explain in a more integrated way why Sussex is the right place.

Unique environment at Sussex. Composers, philosophers, scientific researchers, cultural theorists. I am fascinated by this environment.

Mention the school of cultural studies and their current theme. As well as the department of philosophy.

Group references as applicable.

1. Voice
Holly Herndon. School of voice. Samuel Beckett project. ALMAT.
Cognition of speech perception? Sinetone speech?

2. Movement
Robotics. Marco's work. Blood sweeping arm. The blind robot.
Sussex people?

3. Time
Predictive cognition. Warrick's work. School of composition.
An epic suite, of sorts
And aesthetic ruleset, a theory, to follow and dig deeper deeper into


How to group references, and theories? A starting point.


# 5 Why Me?

* Worked professionally as a software engineer for 3 years
* Able to design and produce custom hardware and software
* Applied AI in most recent work

Navigating the accepted frameworks of scientific knowledge as an artist is hard.
I am experienced in navigating this zone; negotiating rigor with freedom, imagination, play and intuition.

* Co-developed the digital media bachelors program at the University of Leuphana; where I was the only practitioner in a cultural studies department. Won the Leuphana Teaching award for hybrid/interdisciplinary pedagogy.
* I've worked actively at the intersection of theory and practice, culture, philosophy and science (Computational Ontologies, Automation Representation, Live Code and Live Algorithms)

I am an accomplished, practicing artist who brings that professionalism with me in my work here. Thus I will strive to make work at Sussex that succeeds outside the ivory tower.
* I've been commissioned to create work for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam
* commissioned to compose music and created interactive stage sets for top-ranking, nationally touring dance and theatre ensembles in the NL.

My approach to exploring artistic questions is multi-faceted. It involves deep material/empirical research; cultural research; and collaboration/discussion through a curatorial practice. I am very comfortable organizing cultural events to bring minds together around the questions I am researching. And to draw a red line from material, empirical research to cultural studies and philosophy through the unique vehicle of interdisciplinary art. I also have a wide and lively network of practitioners in the arts and research to draw on and make collaborations between Sussex and outwards (e.g. Augmented Instruments Lab in London, Critical Media Lab Basel, Centre for Digital Culture Leuphana and multiple arts institutions in the NL such as V2, iii, Fiber, Rewire Festival, ...) for presentation & dissemination.
* The Reading Room
* Two Sussex folks present in various forms: Andy Clark in our Natural Born Cyborgs session / Warrick in our "Time in the Age of Algorithms" session.



__Thank you very much. I look forward to fielding your questions about this project__

__Moreover, I look forward to working in the company of researchers who nurture a healthy and compassionate working environment based in curiosity, rigor and care__

# Revised Gantt Chart
Include a dynamic between theory and practice throughout.
Each project requires a literature review, and chapter writing, discussion and symposia, etc.
Theory is part of all the work.
